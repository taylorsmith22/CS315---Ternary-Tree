Project Description:
This project is intended to act as ternary tree.
The program will take in a number of integers, putting them into their respective node. 
It will then print the ternary tree in order from least to greatest with parentheses to show which data values belong to what families.

Expected Input: 
The program expects an integer value as a command line argument, which tells the program how many data values it wants to be entered into the ternary tree.
The program also uses the randGen.pl file with the piping operator(|) to pipe random numbers into the simulation.

Expected Output: 
The program will print the ternary tree in order with parentheses to show which data values belong to which nodes/families

How to compile:
To compile the program type: make run
